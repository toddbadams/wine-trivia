# Northern Rhône [FR-NRH]

_PDO_  AOC

##Geography
 - The valley is narrow and steep, and vineyards are mainly planted close to the river, where the best have south-facing aspect. Much smaller region than Southern Rhône

##Climate
 - moderate continental
 - Temperatures are noticeably cooler than in the Southern Rhône

##Varieties

- _Syrah_ the only black variety permitted. At the northern limit of successful ripening, therefore southern aspect and steep slopes are important. Deep color, medium to high tanning, black fruit, sometimes black pepper and floral aromas. Some winemakers use high portion of new oak, others use older oak or larger barrels. 
- _Viognier_ full-bodied white with perfumed aromas of blossom and apricots, flavours of stone fruits.  Sometimes blended with Syrah to add aromatic intensity. Very late ripening, so the wines tend to have low acidity and high alcohol. New oak can be used, but can overwhelm the varietal aromas. Some late-harvested off-dry styles.
- _Marsanne_ and _Roussanne_  usually blended together.  Marsanne has richness and weight, Roussanne offers acidity and perfumed fruit characteristics. These wines do not have aromatic intensity of Viognier but age with complex hazelnut aromas.




# Côte Rôtie (roasted slope) [FR-NRH-COT]

_PDO_  AOC

##Geography
 - The most northern appellation, almost entirely steep slopes with southern aspects. 


##Varieties

- _Only red wines are produced, up to 20 percent Viognier can be blended, but in practice only a limited number of wines produced with Viognier in the blend, and then only a small percentage.
