#Bordeaux [FR-BOR]
_PDO_ AOC

##Geography
- The region is broken into two major areas for top-quality, the Left Bank, and the Right Bank.


##Climate
- moderate maritime
- The warming ocean current extends the growing season: spring frosts are rare and ripening well into October. 
- The Atlantic also brings high levels of rainfall and humidity, which can disrupt flowering and fruit set, promote rot and dilute flavours.
- Vintage variation is an important consideration, top producers reject unhealthy and unripe grapes.

##Varieties
- Thirteen varieties are permitted, but three black grapes and two white predominate.
- Powerful, dry reds made with mostly **Cabernet Sauvignon** and **Merlot**.
- Dry white made mostly from **Sauvignon Blanc**.
- Luscious white made mostly from **Semillon**
- **Merlot** is the most widely used variety. Serves as the primary wine in the Right Bank, used as blending variety on the Left Bank, giving soften tannin structures and ripe fruits.
- Cabernet Sauvignon is the main variety in the Left Bank, used as a blending variety on the Right Bank
- **Semillon** is the dominate white variety used in botrytised wines.  Produces full-bodied wines with honey.  Also blended into Sauvignon Blanc in small percentage adding body and softening acidity.
- **Petit Verdot** far smaller plantings than Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and Merlot. Fully ripens only in very hot years, giving deep color, tannins. It plays a minor role in the blend, adding color and spicy notes.

##Classification
- The 1855 classification is an official list of the best red wines of the Médoc and Graves and the best white wines of Sauternes.
- Chateaux (estate or winery) within this classification are Cru Classé divided into five ranks
- Further classification Cru Bourgeois later introduced for other chateaux, awarded to specific vintages
