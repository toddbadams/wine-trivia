key - FR-BOR
name - Bordeaux
gi - AOC
Geography - The region is broken into two major areas for top-quality, the Left Bank, and the Right Bank.
climate - moderate maritime
The warming ocean current extends the growing season: spring frosts are rare and ripening well into October. 
The atlantic also brings high levels of rainfall and humidity, which can disrupt flowering and fruit set, promote rot and dilute flavours.
Vintage variation is an important consideration, top producers reject unhealthy and unripe grapes.
varieties -
Thirteen varieties are permitted, but three black grapes and two white predominate.
Powerful, dry reds made with mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.
Dry white made mostly from Sauvignon Blanc.
Luscious white made mostly from Semillon
Merlot is the most widely used variety. Serves as the primary wine in the Right Bank, used as blending variety on the Left Bank, giving soften tannin structures and ripe fruits.
Cabernet Sauvignon is the main variety in the Left Bank, used as a blending variety on the Right Bank
Semillon is the dominate white variety used in botrytised wines.  Produces full-bodied wines with honey.  Also blended into Sauvignon Blanc in small percentage adding body and softening acidity.
Petit Verdot - far smaller plantings than Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and Merlot. Fully ripens only in very hot years, giving deep color, tannins. It plays a minor role in the blend, adding color and spicy notes.
Classification - 
The 1855 classification is an official list of the best red wines of the Médoc and Graves and the best white wines of Sauternes.
Chateaux (estate or winery) within this classification are Cru Classé divided into five ranks
